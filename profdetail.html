            <h1>Let's Get Professional!</h1>
            <h2>Get to know Julia on a professional level!</h2>
            <p>
              I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Innovation and Inclusivity through the Interdisciplinary Studies major. I am creating my own degree program at my university to study the intersection of Business Administration, Public Health, and Sociology and to explore technological innovations that reduce the inequality gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this time of rapid technological development, innovative healthcare services constantly disrupt the public health landscape. While these innovations improve the lives of privileged few, these technological advances significantly increate the social inequalities in health. Categorized as a human rights issue, health inequality remains an emerging social issue as distribution of income has never been more unequal than today. This issue of accessibility and inclusivity prompted my research in innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am specifically enthused and interested in product roles because of the fast-paced environment working with diverse teams to create breakthrough technology solutions. Please feel free to take a look at my resume and LinkedIn and contact me at juliaide@berkeley.edu. Thank you!
