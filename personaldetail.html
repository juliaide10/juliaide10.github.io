            <h2>Get to know Julia on a personal level!</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Julia and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a Japanese-American woman born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I am currently living in Berkeley, California studying Innovation and Inclusivity at UC Berkeley. My parents separately immigrated to the U.S. from Japan when they were about the same age I am now. Through Saturday Japanese school for 14 years, I learned Japanese while going to American school like every other kid. I played basketball growing up and ran track and field for a couple years as well! I am interested in health and fitness and this comes hand-in-hand with my love for learning about nutrition! The image below is a black and white film photograph that I took in Tokyo, Japan.
